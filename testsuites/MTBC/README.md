##### *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* testsuites

This directory contains a constructed ancestor genome of *Mycobacterium
tuberculosis* complex ([MTBC]) as well as the following [KvarQ] testsuites:

* `phylo.py` : detects the main 7 lineages (see Comas *et al*, Nature Genetics,
  2013)
* `resistance.py` : detects common drug resistance conferring mutations as well
  as new mutations in some short gene regions
* `spoligo.py` : spoligotyping using 43 well preserved spacers (from
  [SpolPred])
* `example.py` : useless but working and abundantly annotated example testsuite
