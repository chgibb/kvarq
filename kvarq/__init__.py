#   - first number changes between major releases; 0=pre-release
#   - second number changes when incompatabilities arise in .json file-format
#     or internal changes that impede compatability with testsuites (although
#     from version 0.10.10 on old files should be read too)
#   - third number : increments with every compatible change
